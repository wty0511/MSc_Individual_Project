## A Hybrid Way for Few-shot Bioacoustic Event Detection

### Introduction
Welcome to the repository of the MSc Individual Project. This project aims to develop a solution for detecting bioacoustic events in a hybrid way. 

### Getting Started

#### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Before running the code, please download the dataset from the following link: [DCASE 2021 Task 5: Few-shot Bioacoustic Event Detection](https://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection). After downloading, please put Training Set, Validation Set, and Evaluation Set in the following directories respectively:

- `Data_Set/Training_Set`
- `Data_Set/Validation_Set`
- `Data_Set/Evaluation_Set`

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
After setting up the dataset, run the `data_processing.py` script to perform pre-processing.
